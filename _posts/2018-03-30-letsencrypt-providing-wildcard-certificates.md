I'm very happy today to learn that [Let's Encrypt is now providing wilcard certificates](https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/acme-v2-and-wildcard-certificate-support-is-live/55579) as they anounced last July.

As a reminder Let's Encrypt is a free certificate authority providing SSL/TLS certificates for free using an automated process since December 2015. In a few months they became the number 1 certificate authority in the world.

This news make this service even more awesome than it was already.
